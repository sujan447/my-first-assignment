            <p class="skill-p">HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the building block of web pages. It uses tags to define the structure and content of what you see on a website, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.  Think of it as the skeleton that gives a web page its shape and meaning.</p>
